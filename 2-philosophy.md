##Testing is not 'necessary'
In order to get a computer to tell you what `1 + 1` is, you don't need to write tests. This fact,
more than any other, illuminates our cultural attitudes towards testing. Why test when it isn't
necessary to the end result?

##Friends are not 'necessary'

Programming has a reputation of being about pure logic, results are either right or wrong. There are
no subjective answers to `1 + 1`. If testing is not necessary to the output of `2` then what is its
justification? Inevitably, such discussions must venture into the philosophical.

Testing is as meaningful and relevant as friendship. As in human friends. People you hang out with
on a regular basis. Laugh with, argue with. Ask for favours, go out of your way for. And so on.
Friends aren't strictly necessary, well in a certain cold interpretation of the word 'necessary'. We can
get through life, or at least, our bodies can, without friends. We can breath, eat and build things
without friends. The same can be said for tests, we can write all the programs we want without them.
But something would be starkly missing.

##Writing tests and writing programs are different skill sets
In the same way it might take us a few years to learn and appreciate programming, it could take us
a similar amount of time and effort to appreciate the skill of testing. It's like testing uses a
different part of the brain. You write a program from the inside, you are the program. You write
tests from the outside, you are the user.

##Testing changes how you write programs
> If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself    
> *&mdash; Albert Einstein*

In order to test code you often have to break it up and refactor in order to isolate individual pieces
for testing. Far from being an inconvenience, it almost always serves the code. Architecture becomes
more organised and intuitive. Functions become more focused.

So we could rephrase Einstein's quote;
> If you can't write tests for it, you don't understand it yourself

##Testing is a sensibility
Testing is an acquired taste. It has more in common with a way of life than a technical proficiency.
It's a perspective. And if you've never written a test suite before can be a refreshing and
invigorating way of looking at something that might have become all-too familiar and predictable.
